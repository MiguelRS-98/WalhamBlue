                With Chelsea Football Club virtually bankrupt and stuck in Division Two in the early 
                1980s, it was bought by businessman Ken Bates, ending the long Mears dynasty. However 
                as part of the ownership change, the stadium became owned by a separate company and 
                former club directors sold shares in that to property developers.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Chelsea had an initial right to continue playing at the Bridge but now faced a fight to 
                remain long-term, with the spectre of housing or a supermarket there instead and the 
                team sharing with the likes of Fulham or QPR horrifying fans.
                <br></br><br></br>
                A bitter, expensive and close-run 10-year battle ensued, which put any further ground 
                development on hold and gave birth to a ‘Save the Bridge’ campaign to raise money for 
                legal costs.
                <br></br><br></br>
                A collapse in the property market came to our aid and with an ironic twist it was the 
                developers who were forced into bankruptcy, and in 1992 Chelsea Football Club got our 
                ground back.
                <br></br><br></br>
                It was a close shave at times but Stamford Bridge had survived and in 1993, the process 
                of turning a dilapidated ground with views far from the pitch into one of the most 
                impressive stadiums in the country began, with Bates also introducing the Chelsea Pitch 
                Owners scheme to protect the club from any such threat in the future.
