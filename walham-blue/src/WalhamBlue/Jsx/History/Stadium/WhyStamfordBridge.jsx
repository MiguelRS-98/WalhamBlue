                The name Stamford Bridge is one with great significance in English history, having been the 
                site in Yorkshire of a succesful battle against the Vikings in 1066, immediately prior to 
                defeat by the Normans at the Battle of Hastings.
                <br></br><br></br>
                However the naming of Chelsea Football Club's stadium is all about local landmarks rather 
                than conquest from abroad.
                <br></br><br></br>
                On 18th-Century maps showing the Fulham Road and King's Road area there is a stream called 
                'Stanford Creek' which runs along the route of the present-day railway line behind the 
                East Stand. It flowed down into the Thames.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Where the stream crosses the Fulham Road it is marked 'Little Chelsea Bridge' which was 
                originally called Sanford Bridge (from sand ford), while a bridge over the stream on the 
                King's Road was called Stanbridge (from stone bridge). It seems that these two bridge names 
                and that of the stream, 'Stanford Creek', together evolved into the name Stanford Bridge, 
                which again later changed into Stamford Bridge, to become the adopted name of the stadium 
                close by.
                <br></br><br></br>
                A bridge taking the Fulham Road over a railway line remains in place today, close to the 
                main Stamford Gate entrance to the stadium site.
