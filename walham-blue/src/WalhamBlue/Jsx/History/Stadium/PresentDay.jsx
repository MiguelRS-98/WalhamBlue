                The current capacity stands at just over 41,000 and the ground has gone from being a 
                huge oval shape to one with all four sides close to the pitch. There is almost no part 
                of the current stadium that hasn't markedly changed in recent years with only the huge 
                old Shed wall remaining from the original stadium. It be can be seen outside of the 
                current ground, opposite the Megastore and box office.

                As well as all the work on the stadium itself, much of the remaining 12.5 acre site has 
                seen building work, with two four-star hotels, restaurants, conference and banqueting 
                facilities, an underground car park, a health club, a music venue and business centre 
                all added.

                Stamford Bridge has come a long, long way since the original athletics venue was first 
                opened in 1877, as can be seen in the video below, which is one of many features telling 
                the Chelsea FC story in the club's extensive and exciting Museum.
